        <h1>Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
        <p>An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal. This classic omelette combines beaten eggs <br> cooked to perfection, optionally filled with your choice of cheese, vegetables, or meats.</p>
        <h3>Preparation Time</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Total: Approximately 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Preparation: 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Cooking: 5 minutes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
            <li>Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are <br> well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
            <li>Heat the pan: Place a nom-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the <br> pan to ensure the egg evenly coats the surface.</li>
            <li>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slighty runny <br> in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
            <li>Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it <br> over the fillings. Let it continue for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
            <li>Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
        </ol>
